= Parallels and Apple Silicon to play with K8s 

This is a multi-node Kubernetes cluster on Parallels and Apple Silicon. It is using the kubeadm tool to create the cluster.

It uses Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) as the base image. It used kubernets 1.30. 


This is a demo of how to run a Kubernetes cluster on Parallels and Apple Silicon. it is working with Antrea, I have not tested with Calico yet. 

* Later I will add Traefik for ingress controller.
* Quick demo can be done with the following:


I have added the alias for kubectl to the .bashrc file. Therefore you can just use k instead of kubectl.


----
k run nginx --image=nginx
k port-forward nginx 8888:80 --address 10.37.129.100
----

Then from your machine you can use your browser to access the nginx webpage.

----
curl http://10.37.129.100:8888 
----


NOTE: if you are using a Mac with Apple Silicon, you need to use the arm64 images I tested with nginx and arm64v8/httpd. 

== HELM
helm charts for the following are installed:
* Traefik
* Metallb 

== Metallb 
Metallb is installed and running. The  IP address range will need to applied and the config file is autogenerated and available on the vagrant home folder. 

== Traefik
Traefik is not installed by default. It is possible to install by the helm chart as the repo has been added. The default values for it are extracted and are available in the vagrant home folder.
